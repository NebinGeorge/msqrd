# HEPMC and Analysis files for mass squared plots in EIC-dRICH.
## HEPMC files and ana files
Hepmc file and ana file is available in the folder hepmc and ana respectively.
## Particle Information and Parameter Ranges

### Particles Included
1. **Electron**
2. **Pion**
3. **Kaon**
4. **Proton**

### Parameter Ranges(Randomly generated)
- **Momentum (GeV/c):** 0 - 60
- **Pseudorapidity (η):** 2 - 3
- **Phi (φ in degrees):** 0 - 360

The particles were selected randomly during HEPMC file generation, with their momentum, pseudorapidity, and phi values randomised within the specified ranges.

## Code
For the generation of mass square plots following files were edited 
- CherenkovPIDAnalysis.cc
- CherenkovPIDAnalysis.h

The files are available in the folder code.
